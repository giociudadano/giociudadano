**Hiya! Thanks for checking out my profile!**

I'm Gio, a hobbyist game developer that specializes in mobile development, database management, and machine learning. To learn more about game development, I created a few projects that you may want to take your time and check out. My passion is to eventually develop my own games that are beloved by many players, to create a footprint in the games industry and to be a future inspiration for other junior game developers.
